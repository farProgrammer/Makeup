            <p>
              Confession: The last time I can recall having bare nails was when
              I was a 5-year-old. When I was 6, my mom painted my tiny nails
              before a ballet recital, and they haven‚Äôt been bare since. The
              shade was Essie‚Äôs Ballet Slippers (great choice, Mom). I am a
              nail-polish obsessive and if you do the math, I‚Äôve been obsessed
              for almost two decades. I‚Äôve had more drunken nail-polish-shopping
              binges than I care to admit. At home, I wear rubber gloves for
              more than just washing dishes for fear of ruining my mani. Last
              week, my manicurist staged an actual intervention: She told me I
              needed a breather and sent me home with naked nails. So you can
              trust me when I say that I‚Äôve tried every polish on the market.
              and these are the ones I know won‚Äôt let me down. Read on for my
              list, broken down by how long each polish lasts.

              If you‚Äôre ever looking for discontinued UD products, periodically
              search the sale section on the Urban Decay website. A friend who
              works in PR for UD suggested this tip, and it‚Äôs turned up gold! I
              found the sadly discontinued Cannonball Mascara there, and I got
              three tubes! It‚Äôs something to keep in mind if you love a
              particular UD product that‚Äôs no longer stocked on shelves. Anyway,
              candy. My childhood next door neighbor Karrie and I would ride our
              bikes to the corner store to buy candies that would probably break
              my teeth now if I ate them, ha ha ha! Lemon Heads, Boston Baked
              Beans, and these little hard blue jawbreaker-like candies whose
              name I can‚Äôt recall‚Ä¶ I want to call them ‚Äúblueberry somethings,‚Äù
              but I can‚Äôt remember. We also loved Nerds and the powder dips
              where you‚Äôd get a sugary stick to dip into even more sugar. üòÅ
              We‚Äôd gorge on candy right in front of the store, then take our
              sugar high onto our bikes and ride around the neighborhood for
              hours. By the way, about this look I‚Äôm wearing, the upper lid has
              a swish of black liner via Chanel Hyperblack, which I‚Äôve been
              extra loving lately. It‚Äôs similar to MAC Blacktrack but so much
              better because it‚Äôs darker and more intense (so less layering),
              and it sticks like glue to lash and waterlines. SO GOOD!

            <p>
              I recently teamed up with Maybelline on Instagram to do a
              sponsored post for their newest Made for All lipsticks. I was so
              impressed, that I wanted to do a blog post just for fun
              (#notspon). Maybelline lipsticks have always been my favorite from
              the drug store. There is a huge range of colors and finishes and I
              really think they‚Äôve set themselves apart from other drugstore
              brands in that way.
            </p>
            <img

              style={{ borderRadius: "50%", width: "20rem" }}
            />
            <p>
              These are 3 of the 7 shades from the collection. The collection
              has matte and satin finishes and was tested on over 50 skin tones.
              They wanted to create the perfect red, pink, mauve, ect. that
              would be flattering on EVERY skin tone. If you‚Äôve ever tried to
              match a lipstick, let alone a drugstore lipstick, you‚Äôll know what
              a task this is. You can read about some other experiences with the
              lipsticks on Elle as well. I had a lot of success with these 3
              shades, although I‚Äôm just one person. Based on what I‚Äôve seen and
              read though, I think Maybelline really nailed it, so I wanted to
              share some swatches in hopes that it might give people a frame of
              reference when shopping!
